    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
      Slack bots are becoming central to many workflows, especially when
      automating internal tools or supporting teams. But when I was tasked with
      testing one of ours end-to-end, I realized that most testing frameworks
      fall short. Unit tests can verify the logic, but they don't validate how
      the bot behaves in Slack itself. That's when I turned to SeleniumBase, and
      this post is a reflection of what I learned through that journey.
    </p>

      The Problem: Testing Slack Bots Reliably
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Our bot was meant to respond to slash commands and interactive messages.
      Manually testing those in Slack every time was slow and error-prone. I
      needed a way to simulate real user behavior, sending commands, interacting
      with buttons, and checking the bot's responses, all inside a real Slack
      workspace.
    </p>

      Why SeleniumBase?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I evaluated a few headless browser testing tools, but SeleniumBase stood
      out for a few reasons. It wraps Selenium with a friendlier Python syntax,
      includes smart wait handling, visual logs, and even built-in Slack
      integration features. It felt like the right balance between simplicity
      and power for UI-focused automation.
    </p>

    >
      My Testing Approach
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I set up a dedicated Slack workspace for testing and used SeleniumBase to
      automate the login flow, navigate to a channel, type a slash command, and
      wait for the bot's response. I also tested buttons in interactive messages
      by simulating clicks and verifying changes. To keep things clean, each
      test started with a new browser session and included screenshots on
      failure.

      Challenges I Faced
    </h2>
    <ul
      class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2"
    >
      <li>
        Slack's dynamic UI makes selectors brittle. I had to be cautious with
        XPath vs. CSS selectors and often relied on visible text matching.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate limits and Slack's load times can introduce flakiness. I introduced
        retries and used SeleniumBase's wait-for methods generously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two-factor authentication was a blocker initially. I used app passwords
        or test accounts with relaxed security settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Lessons Learned
    </h2>
    <ul
      class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2"
    >
      <li>
        Test what matters most. Full end-to-end tests are costly, so I focused
        only on flows that couldn't be covered in unit or integration tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Debuggability is key. SeleniumBase's video recording and HTML logs were
        lifesavers when a test failed overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean test environments help. I used dedicated Slack channels for
        testing and cleared them between runs to avoid noise.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Looking Ahead
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      While SeleniumBase isn't perfect for every use case, it gave me the
      confidence to catch regressions before they hit production. Next, I'm
      exploring Slack's API and combining it with SeleniumBase to validate both
      frontend and backend in the same test run. Automation is never done, but
      this was a big step forward.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      If you're building or maintaining Slack bots, don't stop at logic tests.
      Bring in some real-world automation and catch bugs the way users will
      actually see them. I'm glad I did.
